<h3> Week 0: 9/26 </h3>
<p> Working on assingment 0 was definitely a learning curve.  I had never used html or github prior to this week so figuring out certain things was a little tricky.  With html it was mostly figuring out how to type out the code and being able to see it on a webpage.  For github, working through the process of commiting and pushing was a little difficult to grasp at first.  However using Piazza and seeing other students questions and answers as well as using the git tutorials really helped with this assignment.</p>
